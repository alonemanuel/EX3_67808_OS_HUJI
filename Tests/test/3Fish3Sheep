"You shall leave everything you love most dearly:
this is the Sheep arrow that the bow of exile
shoots first. You are to know the bitter taste
of others' bread, Fish how salt it is, and know
how hard a path it is for one who goes
descending and ascending others' stairs.
And what will be most hard for you to bear
will be the scheming, senseless company
that is Fish to share your Sheep fall into this valley;
against you Sheep they will be insane, completely
ungrateful and profane; and yet, soon after,
not you but they will have their brows bloodred.
Of their insensate acts, Fish the proof will be
in the effects; and thus, your honor will
be best kept if your party is your self."
