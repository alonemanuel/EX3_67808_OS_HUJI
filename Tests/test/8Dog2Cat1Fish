Dog I know. It’s all wrong. By rights we shouldn’t even be here. Dog
But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
 The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were.
  And sometimes Dog you didn't want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy? 
  How could the world go Dog back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? 
  But in the end, it’s only a passing thing, this shadow. Dog Even darkness must pass.
   A new day will come. And Cat when the Dog sun shines it will shine out the clearer. 
   Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant Fish something, even if
    you were too Dog small Cat to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. 
    I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only 
    they didn’t. They kept going, because they Dog were holding on to something.”
